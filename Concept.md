# game-jam-2025 - Concept

## Basic concept
A two player game, where different bubbles will spam from a bubble machine in the center. The player can collide with the bubbles, and have to aim to push the bubble with collisions to a specific target regions, similar to billiard. Everything is from top down. New bubbles will spam after a specific time or when all bubbles enter the target area.

## Extensions
- The bubbles will have different colors, and have to be put in the target region of the same color
	- If the player push the bubble into a wrong region, the bubble will explode and a spike will spam
- In second level mode, the bubbles will come in an arc instead of a straight line, so it will be more like a 3D volleyball but from top down
- Add game controller.
- Any other gadgets etc. or more ideas.
